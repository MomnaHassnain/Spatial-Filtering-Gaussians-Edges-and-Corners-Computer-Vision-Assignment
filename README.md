# Spatial Filtering, Gaussians, Edges, and Corners â€“ Computer Vision Assignment

This repository contains the implementation of various image processing techniques using OpenCV as part of **Assignment 1** for the *EC 803 Computer Vision* course. The assignment focuses on fundamental concepts of spatial filtering, edge detection, and feature extraction.

## ðŸ“Œ Topics Covered:
- **Convolution Operation**: Implementing convolution from scratch without built-in functions.
- **Averaging Filters**: Applying different filter sizes and analyzing their effects.
- **Gaussian Filtering**: Creating a Gaussian filter using mathematical formulas.
- **Gaussian Convolution**: Applying Gaussian smoothing on images.
- **Gaussian Blur & Canny Edge Detection**: Performing edge detection on blurred and original images.
- **Edge Map Filters**: Detecting edges using Sobel, Scharr, or custom filters.
- **Corner Detection**: Using the Harris corner detection algorithm to highlight key points.
- **Bitwise Operations**: Creating shapes through binary operations on images.
- **Feature Extraction**: Implementing **SIFT** and **SURF** to detect and describe image keypoints.

## ðŸš€ How to Run:
1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/spatial-filtering-assignment.git
   ```
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install numpy opencv-python
   ```
3. Run the Jupyter Notebook or Python scripts for each task.

## ðŸ“· Sample Outputs:
Screenshots of image processing results are included in the repository.
